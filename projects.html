      <h4>Pre-Operational Testing System (POTSy)</h4>
        <div style="padding-right: 30px;">
          <p>The pre-operational testing system used at Twelve is a system that tests the sealing integrity and electrical characteristics of an electrochemical reactor. An additional part of developing the system was developing diagnostics for leak detection upon discovering a gas leak. The image below shows a scaled-down version of the reactors this testing system scanned.</p>

          <h4>Gen 1 POTSy</h4>
          <p style="padding-left:45px;" style="padding-right: 30px;">
            When I started at Twelve, I was assigned work on the leak and electrical testing systems for the new generation of reactor. The specifications had been written out with Synapse, who supported the electrical and hardware integration into an executable program.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left:45px;" style="padding-right: 30px;">
            <i>Hardware and Process Development</i><br>
            I worked alongside Synapse to complete the site acceptance testing (SAT) of the electrical testing system. Afterwards, I had to design the pressure testing system. This involved creating a P&ID of the proposed schematic, procuring the components, assembly, and testing. The system was designed to test the reactor with a 1.5 factor of safety for operations. I decided on mass flow meters (MFMs) as the device that would give a leak rate reading, and developed the process for testing the leak rates of the membrane, anode, and cathode sides of the reactor.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div style="padding-right: 30px;">
          <h4>Gen 2 POTSy</h4>
          <p style="padding-left:45px;" style="padding-right: 30px;">From the experience and learnings of POTSy 1, I was tasked with designing the next generation of the testing system that was automated and easier to scale.</p>
          <p style="padding-left:45px;">
            <i>Requirements Gathering</i><br>
            First was requirements gathering on the testing side as well as creating a facilites requirement list. This included creating P&IDs for the system and pressure drop lines, creating specifications for compressed air lines and additional gas cylinders. From this I created testing schematic flowcharts to give to Synapse, who again supported the hardware integration into an application.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left:45px;">
            <i>Development</i><br>
            I procured pressure decay systems, flowmeters, AC resistance measurement devices, battery testers and respective connection components to assemble the pressure testing cabinet in-house and electrical components to send to Synapse for assembly. The in-house plumbing assembly was a month-long project that involved component safety assessment and justification, complex tube bending, and high pressure leak testing and troubleshooting. SAT was performed with Synapse once the electrical system arrived in-house and the pneumatic cabinet was complete. I conducted a Gage R+R for both the electrical and pneumatic components to gain confidence in the reliability of the system.
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left:45px;">
            <i>Training & Support</i><br>
            The final phase of this year-long project was to prepare it for handoff to the Reactor Operations team. The transition from Engineering to Operations required a standard operating procedure to be written and a job hazard analysis to be conducted from it. After completing those, I trained the Ops team by having them shadow the procedure and follow along on the SOP, followed by reverse shadowing and sign off on training.

      <h4>Subassembly Leak Tester</h4>
        <div style="padding-right: 30px;">
          <p style="padding-left:45px;">
            This project arose from a high failure rate of specific subassemblies. These leaky components were causing reactors to fail in the pre-operational testing phase and resulted in numerous rebuilds. I took over the project after the first version of the leak tester had been designed and manufactured.<br><br>
            <i>Validation and Revision</i><br>
            My first task was to design the pneumatic schematic that enabled quick and easy leak testing of the subassemblies. This ended up being simple design that consisted of an MFM, a needle valve, and some ball valves. It was quickly noticed that the fixture was not able to test to the original designed setpoint, With a small team, we modficiations to the base plate and clamping procedure as well as revisions to the process. Once qualified, we tested 100% of the subassemblies going into the next reactor build and developed the testing procedure that allowed for a quick check to either accept or reject those. This fixture has reduced the number of rebuilds required, resulting in reactor delivery to the electrochemical testing team 9 times faster than before.

        <div style="padding-right: 30px;">
          <p>I represented the R&D team in a cross-functional setting to define requirements for the next generation of tools. The request for the next generation of tools was to increase the growth area of the reactor as well as increase growth rates of the gems. I designed and tested different nozzle geometry for select gas inlets into the chamber. <br><br>
          <i>Impact:</i> These new nozzles opened up the process space for the plasma. This enabled me to play around with different gasses to replicate the performance of the plasma from the previous generation of reactor to the new one. This new set of hardware and experimental plasma recipe opened the growth area of the reactor. This new generation was rolled out in the R&D facility and handed off to the PDev team for optimization.

    <h4>Hive Jr: Interdisciplinary Capstone Project</h4>
    <div style="padding-right: 30px;">
      <p> We worked with CamelBak Products, LLC to expand their product line with a focus on catering to outdoor hydration and carrying needs. The sponsor was looking to expand their target market to include millennial families. </p>
      <p>The observed outcome of this project was be a product that simplified the process for getting outdoors as a family to go day hiking. The proposed product will be an essential tool used by families when considering any outdoor activities. There is no existing product for this identified market, therefore there is a lot of opportunity. With the findings presented in a report to the sponsor, the outdoor goods company will be able to expand their lines and reach a new audience, ultimately shaping the outdoor experience for families.</p>

    <h4>Pancake Maker <small>(Epson 6 Axis Robot)</small></h4>
      <div>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to use an Epson robot with an end-effector to release pancake batter into desired shapes. The first objective was to program the Epson to draw a pre-chosen set of shapes. This was accomplished by selecting images and using Inkscape to create svg files to feed vector coordinates for the robot to follow. Once this was successful, a system was designed to release batter, which was dependent on the orientation of the Epson. Finally, image processing was used to get coordinates from images so that the Epson was capable of making virtually any shape with no limitations.</p>
        <p>My contributions included laser cutting the end effector, writing the script that imported svg files and converted them into plottable points on MATLAB, and creating the images that were to be imported on InkScape. The final product is seen in the video.</p>

      <h3>Scooting Through Atlanta <small>(Interactive Product Design)</small></h3>
        <p>This project consisted of creating a new game controller and console that reset the standard for arcade games. Inspired by the old driving games, we decided to create 'Scooter Through Atlanta'. The project had three main parts: the prototype of the controller (our scooter), the mechanics of the game which were done with an Arduino, and the Processing portion which created the physical game.</p>

        <br>
        <p>I was in charge of assembling the Arduino components and putting together the scooter. First, each of the components was created and tested, then they were integrated into the scooter one at a time to ensure each worked properly. This presented a lot of challenges since the controller was designed per existing scooter dimensions, and the wires had to be up to 5 feet long. </p>

      <p>This project incorporated user-centric design methods used to identify, understand, assess and prioritize the factors that contribute to more effective design solutions.</p>
      <p>Methods such as stakeholder identification and analysis (customer discovery), needfinding, social ethnography, videography, as well as introductions to the behavioral and social sciences (psychology, sociology, anthropology, etc) were used and magnified through a design lens. The objective of this project was to identify reasons why Todoist's projected market was not utilizing the product, and to find a solution to the "why". The research and solution is found below.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of apps that allow you to track your period and remind you to take birth control, but they could always be improved. We came up with the idea of an app made for the benefit of women - one that will allow you to track your period, remind you to take your birth control and reward you when you do so.
        Beyond that, we wanted the app to include sexual education resources, and allow you to connect with nearby health centers. We aimed to develop a user friendly and intuitive app.</p>
